###Â Set of functions to produce data-driven, personalised metrics on video games.

- Initially, we wanted to find an objective way to rank video games, then find a metric based on adding a bit of subjectivity to this.
- We have a set of rankings that should be consistent across people, e.g. we should all agree that The Last Of Us has a Narrative parameter of 1.0 (from 0 to 1)
- Then, one can add their *weights* based on their experience of the game.
- Sticking these into a formula (very roughly), produces a metric. 

- Creating a database of games with consistent rankings, could be used to help players decide what type of game they'd like to play (future)
